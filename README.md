# Tongue-Tesseract : The Neural Machine Translation
# Tongue Tesseract: The Neural Machine  

## Overview  
**Tongue Tesseract** is a cutting-edge Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system designed to push the boundaries of language understanding and translation. This project employs advanced deep learning architectures and NLP techniques to deliver high-accuracy translations, with future enhancements targeting real-time processing and handling of linguistically complex or grammatically incorrect inputs.  

## Features  
- Built using state-of-the-art models like **RNNs**, **LSTM**, and **Transformer architectures** for NMT.  
- Enhanced language detection capabilities with **RNNs** and **Naive Bayes** algorithms.  
- Comprehensive preprocessing pipeline including **Bag-of-Words**, **Word2Vec**, **lemmatization**, and **tokenization**.  
- User-friendly interface powered by **Streamlit** for seamless interaction.  
- Future-ready with planned support for **real-time translation** and innovative grammar interpretation techniques.
